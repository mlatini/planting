Remove runners and flowers until July of the first year to give the roots time to develop, and then allow plants to produce fruit.

The fruit of most species contains capsaicin, which gives hot peppers their spiciness. Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) are an exception: they do not contain capsaicin due to a recessive gene, and are therefore not spicy. The Scoville scale is used to measure the relative heat of peppers. Bell peppers have a rating of 0-25 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), jalapenos are between 2,500-10,000 SHU. All peppers, regardless of species, prefer a long, warm growing season and well-drained soil high in organic matter. Seeds can be started indoors 8-10 weeks before hardening off and transplanting. In cooler climates, it can be preferable to grow peppers in containers indoors to extend the growing season and prevent frost from killing plants.

The small fruit are green, ellipsoid, and the size of an egg.

The fruit is eaten raw or added to smoothies. The edible flower petals can be added to salads. Fruit is best when allowed to ripen on the tree. A tarp or large cloth can be hung around the tree to catch fruit when it falls and prevent bruising.

Fig trees have an aggressive root system that searches for groundwater in aquifers, ravines, and cracks in rocks. Once established, they can tolerate seasonal drought and are affected by few pests.

Peaches and nectarines are the same species - nectarines have a recessive gene that makes their skin smooth rather than fuzzy. Cultivated peaches are divided into two groups: clingstones and freestones, depending on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not. Peaches can have white or yellow fuzzy skin. Yellow peaches usually have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness. White peaches are very sweet with little acidity. Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around 0 to 10 ¬∞C during the winter, and hot temperatures in the summer to ripen fruit. Some varieties are self-pollinating, while others require pollination by a peach tree of another variety with the same bloom period within 50 feet. Peaches should be thinned to 7-12cm apart when fruit are 2-3cm in diameter to increase mature fruit size. Standard and dwarf rootstocks are available. Dwarf trees can grow to 3 meters, standard to 4.5 meters. Depending on the size chosen, the tree will bear fruit within 2-4 years of planting.","slug":"peach","alternate_names":[],"scientific_names":["Prunus persica"],"photos_count":6,"plantings_count":6,"harvests_count":5,"planters_ids":[807,1136,1136,258,44,6306],"has_photos":true,"thumbnail_url":"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4156/34301504501_36ea3d3822_z.jpg","scientific_name":"Prunus persica","created_at":1363656628,"id":"147"},{"_index":"crops_production_20200309004756289","_type":"_doc","_id":"254","_score":4.0073333,"name":"aloe vera","description":"Aloe Vera is an evergreen succulent with thick, fleshy leaves with serrated edges.
