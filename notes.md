general workflow. 
  1. supplies needed - 
    1. cup to grow it in (foam cup)
    2. dirt
    3 seed
    4 pen to write on the cup
    5. water
  2. Planting process
    1. write on the cup what you're putting in there, with the date
    2. Put a hole in the bottom of the cup for water to drain
    2. put the dirt in the cup
    3. make a little hole for the seed with your finger
    4. Put the seed in
    5. cover the seed with some dirt
    6. put some water
    7. pray that the seed grows

Once the seed is planted and probably in a greenhouse then you...
  1. water it twice a week in the morning. You should see growth within a week

Daily checklist. 
  1. make sure the plant is not wilted
  2. make sure it's not leggy which means it's too tall with now leaves. If it is, you pull it
  3. check for bugs or bug damage
  4. check for mold or diseases
